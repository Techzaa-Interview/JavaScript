**Question 1: What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** `null` is an explicitly assigned value that represents the absence of any object value, while `undefined` means that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

**Question 2: How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** You cannot directly compare two objects in JavaScript using `==` or `===` because they compare object references, not the actual object values. You would need to compare the properties of the objects manually.

**Question 3: Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.**

**Answer:** In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is achieved through prototypal inheritance, where objects can have a prototype object that serves as a template for the properties and methods of the object.

**Question 4: How do you handle errors in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an error, the `catch` block handles the error if one occurs, and the `finally` block executes code after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

**Question 5: What are closures in JavaScript and how are they used?**

**Answer:** Closures are functions that have access to variables from their containing scope even after the containing function has finished executing. They are used to create private variables and methods in JavaScript.

**Question 6: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** Synchronous code is executed sequentially, blocking further execution until the current operation is completed. Asynchronous code allows the program to continue executing other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete, using callbacks, promises, or async/await.

**Question 7: How does event delegation work in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element, rather than multiple event listeners being attached to individual child elements. This allows you to manage events on dynamically added elements or reduce the number of event listeners needed.

**Question 8: What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the object it belongs to. Its value depends on the context in which it is used. In a method, `this` refers to the owner object, in a function, `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode), and in an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.

**Question 9: What are arrow functions and how do they differ from regular functions?**

**Answer:** Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They do not have their own `this` context and inherit `this` from the enclosing scope. Arrow functions also do not have `arguments` objects, and they cannot be used as constructors.

**Question 10: What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

**Answer:** The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system and running a loop that checks if the call stack is empty and if there are any messages in the message queue to be processed. It handles the execution of asynchronous code.

**Question 11: What are JavaScript Promises and how do they work?**

**Answer:** Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a `then` method to handle success and a `catch` method to handle failure. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

**Question 12: Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript.**

**Answer:** Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
